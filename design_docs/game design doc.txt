We're planning on making a 3D version of the classic breakout game (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IruG7vQE_A).

Gameplay:
	Ball bounces around a 3D scene. If the ball hits a block, then the block dies and the player gets points.
	You can block the ball with a square paddle locked to a plane at the bottom of the map. If the ball passes
	past the paddle, it explodes into flames and the player loses a life.

	After losing 3 lives, the player is dead, and game over.

Scoring:
	Points are given by knocking out blocks.
	When all blocks are knocked out, points are multiplied by time remaining. 

Controls:
	Paddle is control by mouse.
	Camera is locked.

Stretch Goals:
	Camera is rotated about Y-axis, controlled by keyboard.
